### File Conventions

Each part folder may contain:

* `main.py` / `resolver.py` – solution code
* `input.txt` – personal puzzle input
* `test_input.txt` – sample input (when applicable)

---

## 🐍 Tech

* **Python 3.12.0**

* No use of external libraries.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Go to the desired year/day/part:

   ```bash
   cd AdventOfCode/2025/day03/part1
   ```

2. Run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📝 Notes

These solutions prioritize **clarity and learning** over micro-optimizations.
Refactors may happen when I revisit older days/years.

---

## 📌 Goals

* Improve explanations or add brief comments where helpful
* Track progress yearly
* Develop better ideas of how to solve puzzles 
* Future planning: solve the same puzzle using Go
